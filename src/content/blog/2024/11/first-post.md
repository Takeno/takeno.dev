Knowledge sharing has always been my passion: I love sharing what I learn day by day, and I love learning from others' shared experiences. I believe this is the secret of an effective community.

For years I've been telling myself I should have a personal website with a blog. But I never found the right motivation. What should I write about? What stories do I have to tell? What value can I add?
Finally, after years, I convinced myself that the continuous process of _learn by doing_ can be valuable even for people I don't know, just as I learn something new every day from strangers publishing on the web.

This micro blog will be a stream of notes, ideas and experiences. A living archive of knowledge, told with a personal touch that no LLM can replicate. And if nothing else, it will be my personal library of discoveries.

Let's begin!
